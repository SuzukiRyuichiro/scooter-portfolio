  <h1>helloğŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>I am a full-stack web developer and very passionate about technology and computer science. I dreamed of becoming a software enginner ever since I started playing with computers. As a first step to that achieve that goal, I participated 9 week full-time coding bootcamp by <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon Tokyo</a> and graduated in March 2021. Since then, I am learning new concepts everyday to become a better developer.</p>
  <h3>little bit more about me</h3>
  <p>I was born in Tokyo but I have lived in 6 different cities across 4 different countries ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®. I believe this made me adaptive to new environment. I speak English and Japanese both in native level and I love networking with people all over the world with variety of backgrounds.</p>
